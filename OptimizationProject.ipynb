    "## Big Bang Theory Party Planning\n",

    "Penny is organizing a party at her apartment, but she is on a tight budget. Having a working knowledge of all of the important things in the universe, Sheldon knows everything about linear programming and offered to help her. He postulates that it’s ideal to have two kinds of mixed nuts: a plain party mix, and a luxury mix (for those with a distinct taste like himself). Based on the expected number of guests, Howard quickly calculates that they’ll need a total of at least 10 pounds of snacks, but no more than 6 pounds of each kind of mix. On his white board, Sheldon has already come up with the following table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Nuts | Party Mix | Luxury Mix | Other Mix | Cost/lb. | Allergency Level/lb. \n",
    "|------|-----------|------------|-----------|----------|----------------------\n",
    "| Peanuts | No more than 50% | Unrestricted | At least 10% | 3.5 \\$ | 5 \n",
    "| Cashews | At least 15% | At least 30% | No more than 80% | 5 \\$ | 4 \n",
    "| Brazil Nuts | At least 10% | At least 20% | No more than 20% | 7.5 \\$ | 3 \n",
    "| Hazlenuts | Unrestricted | At least 30% | No more than 50 % | 9 \\$ | 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "Raj wants to dip the hazelnuts into liquor, but that’s not in the budget, so he gives up. Leonard reminds everyone that, because of their allergies, it’s important to keep the average allergenicity level per pound in both mixes to no more than 3. Write an optimization model to help Penny prepare the two kinds of snacks at minimum cost. But be careful: Sheldon will check it later for correctness!\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to have enough number of variables we have also added another Mix that was not mentioned in the original formulation of the problem. This mix is called 'Other Mix' and the values for it are those seen in the table."
